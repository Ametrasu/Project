                        Yes, React and laravel both performed according to our expectations. These are both efficent and easy to use tools that provide descriptive documentation 
                        to get you started on your webpages. Using these frameworks helped us in creating the webpages we desired and provided a fun overall experience.

                        <p>
                        No. React and Laravel were both extremely easy to set up. 
                        For React, we used NPM for installation of the software packages and modules which made the process very convenient. 
                        For Laravel, we used Composer to configure the framework.

                        <p>
                        Yes, Since it's very easy to set up, creating the webpages was rather easy with it. 
                        Both laravel and react also offer documentation which is quite easy to understand and offers 
                        the neccessary knowledge to start creating your very own webpage.

                        <p>
                        No, We do not regret our choices for frameworks. For back-end frameworks, Laravel and Django are two popular choices. 
                        Since neither of us have prior experience with Python, we chose using Laravel over Django. It helped us build an interactive website with its vast selection of built-in features. 
                        Similarly, for our front-end choice, React was a great option because it was easy to learn, fast and declarative.
